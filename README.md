# Spatiochromatic contrast sensitivity luminance-dependent model

This repository contains Matlab code for the spatio-chromatic contrast sensitivity function model, which predicts the smallest contrast that is visible to an average human observer.

The SCCSF is modeled as a function of:
* spatial frequency;
* luminance of the background, specified as the LMS cone responses (using CIE LMS 2006 cone fundamentals);
* colour direction, in the LMS space;
* and stimulus size.

Please refer to the script test.m for an example on how to use the model.

The details of the model can be found in the paper:
